% This is sigproc-sp.tex -FILE FOR V2.6SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% OCTOBER 2002
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V2.6SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.6SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
%
%  However, both the CopyrightYear (default to 2002) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (default to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX) can still be over-ridden by whatever the author
% inserts into the source .tex file.
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2003} will cause 2003 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to
% Adrienne Griscti ---> griscti@acm.org
%
% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to
% Gerald Murray ---> murray@acm.org

% For tracking purposes - this is V2.6SP - OCTOBER 2002

% Up to the first three authors are aligned under the title;

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
	The Clojure programming language was first released in 2007. Clojure was designed with several things in mind \cite{cloj:rationale}:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Functional Programming
	\item Concurrency
	\item LISP
	\item "Symbiotic" with an established platform 
	\end{itemize}
	These items are the main

% You must have a proper ".bib" file
